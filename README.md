💻 **Full Stack Developer** | 🚀 **CTO-in-Progress** | 🤓 **Engineer at heart**  

---

### 🌟 About Me  
- 🏗️ I build things that live on the web — from **Next.js micro frontends** to **full-stack apps**.  
- 🔧 Originally a **Mechatronics Engineer**, so yes… I can fix your code *and* your coffee machine.  
- 📈 Obsessed with **performance, SEO, and clean code** (Google Lighthouse and I are basically besties).  
- 🎯 Goal: Become a CTO in 5 years — ask me how, or just watch the journey unfold.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack  
```javascript
const skills = {
  languages: ["JavaScript (ES6+)", "TypeScript", "Python (basic)"],
  frameworks: ["React", "Next.js", "Node.js", "Express"],
  databases: ["MongoDB", "SQL"],
  tools: ["Git", "Jira", "CI/CD", "Supabase"],
  styling: ["Tailwind", "Bootstrap", "SASS", "LESS"],
  extras: ["SEO Optimization", "Core Web Vitals", "Lighthouse Reports"]
};
```

### 🚀 Projects & Highlights  
- 🏢 **OpenSooq**: Built and refactored micro frontends, SDK bundling, and high-traffic Next.js apps.  
- 🎓 **LTUC Teaching Assistant**: Taught future developers how to make `console.log("Hello World")` feel like magic.  
- 📊 **Session Intelligence Platform (WIP)**: Record user sessions → AI analysis → Actionable reports. Basically turning "I think the user clicked there" into *proof*.  
- 🤖 **AI Experiments**: From **daily LinkedIn posting bots** to **automated site audits** — if it can be automated, I’m already coding it.  

---

### 🎯 Fun Facts  
- 🍚 Can survive exclusively on rice dishes (ask me for recommendations).  
- ⚡ Can break production in one line of code — but also fix it in two.  
- 🎨 Love mixing humor with code, because who wants boring commits?

✨ *"Code is like humor. When you have to explain it, it’s bad."* — So I try to write code that makes both sense and laughs.
